This is a digital drawing in a cartoon style featuring two anthropomorphic sloths. Both sloths have brown fur with darker brown markings around their eyes and mouths, giving them a distinctive appearance. The sloth on the left is holding a clipboard and appears to be giving instructions or information. He has a slightly worried expression and is wearing a brown apron. The sloth on the right is holding a large, transparent X-ray sheet, revealing a detailed human skeleton inside. The X-ray sheet is framed by a blue outline, and the skeleton is depicted in white, with prominent ribs and a skull. The sloth on the right also holds a tray filled with golden coins. The background shows a simple, sterile room with white walls and a grid-patterned ceiling. There are two large windows, one on the left and one on the right, allowing natural light to enter. The overall scene suggests a medical or educational setting, with the sloths acting as unusual and humorous figures in a typically serious environment.
