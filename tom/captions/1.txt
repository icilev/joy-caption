The image is a digital drawing in a cartoon style, depicting two anthropomorphic sloths in a medical setting. Both sloths are standing side by side and are dressed in hospital scrubs, with the left one holding a clipboard and pen while the right one holds a transparent x-ray film. The left sloth has a brownish-orange fur and is wearing a white hospital gown, with a brown clipboard in one hand and a brown pen in the other. The right sloth is also brownish-orange, wearing a hospital gown, and holding a transparent x-ray film with a large, circular object inside. The object on the x-ray appears to be a gold coin or a similar round, metallic object. The background features a sterile hospital corridor with light blue walls and white ceiling tiles, creating a stark, clinical atmosphere. The sloths' expressions are serious and focused, suggesting a professional demeanor. The x-ray film is held in the right sloth's hands, with the transparent film allowing the gold object to be seen clearly. The drawing uses bold outlines and flat colors, typical of digital cartoon art.
